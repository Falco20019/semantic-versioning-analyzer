*This is a sanity check that indicates whether the change is more severe than intended.  It is not foolproof as not all changes can be detected by analyzing the public interface of an assembly.  Therefore the results of this check are to be considered as a suggestion.  You may determine that a particular change warrants a more severe version bump than is suggested by this check.*

**Please use your best judgment when updating the version.  You know your change better than this check can.**
